# Choosing the Right Tool For the Job

> As a data analyst, you will usually have to decide which program or solution is right for the particular project you are working on.
>
> Depending on which phase of the data analysis process you’re in, you will need to use different tools. For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualization, then those visualization tools are the best choice. If, for instance, you are focusing on _organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data_ then you will probably be choosing between _spreadsheets and databases using Queries_
>
> Spreadsheets and databases both offer way to **store, manage, and use data**.

## Some Differences

---

> ## Spreadsheets

- Software Applications
- Structure data in “Row and Column” format
- Organize information in cells
- Provides access to a limited amount of data
- Manual Data Entry
- Generally only one active user at a time
- Controlled by the User

> ## Databases

- Data stores - accessed using “Query Language” (eg.SQL)
- Structure data using rules and relationships
- organize information in complex collection
- Provide access to huge amounts of data
- Strict and consistent data entry
- Multiple Users
- Controlled by a database management system

> You don’t have to choose one or the other because each serves its only purpose, Generally, data analysts work with a combination of the two, as both tools are very useful in data analytics. For example, you can store data in a database, then export it to a spreadsheet for analysis. Or, if you are collecting information in a spreadsheet, and it becomes too much for that particular platform, you can import it into a database.
>
> There are also **Programming Languages** such as **R** and **Python** that give you even greater control of your data, it’s analysis, and the visualizations you create with it.
