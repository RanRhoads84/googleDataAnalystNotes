> ## Visualization

- The Graphical Representation of Information
- Graphs
- Charts
- Maps
- Other Design Elements to Represent Data

> ## Strategy

- Strategizing helps analysts see what they want to achieve with the data. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect.

> ## Problem-Orientation

- Data analysts use a problem-oriented approach in order to **_identify, Describe, and Solve Problems_**
- The Goal is to keep the problem at the top of the mind throughout the entire project.

> ## Correlation

- A correlation is a relationship between two or more pieces of data.
- Beware, **Correlation does NOT equal causation**

> ## Big-Picture / Detail-Oriented Thinking

- “Big-Picture”
  - Being able to step back and look at the whole picture.
- “Detail-Oriented”
  - The ability to focus on a small part of an overall picture.
