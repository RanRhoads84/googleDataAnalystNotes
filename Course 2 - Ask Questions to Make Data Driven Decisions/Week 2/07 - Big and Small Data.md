Wether you work with big or small data, you can use it to help stakeholders improve business processes, answer questions, create new products, and much more. But there are certain challenges and benefits that come with bid data and the following table explores the differences between big and small data.

> ## Small Data
>
> - Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined period of time
> - Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets
> - Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses
> - Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent

> ## Big Data
>
> - Describes large, less-specific data sets that cover a long period
> - Usually kept in a database and queried
> - Likely to be used by large organizations
> - Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent
> - Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making

## Challenges and Benefits

Here are some **Challenges** you might face when working with big data:

- A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information
- Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.
- The data you need isn't always easily accessible
- Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias.
- There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

_Now for the good news! Here are some **Benefits** that come with big data:_

- When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.
- Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new productions and solutions that will make customers happy.
- By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.
- As in our earlier social media example, big data helps companies keep track of their online presence-especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.
