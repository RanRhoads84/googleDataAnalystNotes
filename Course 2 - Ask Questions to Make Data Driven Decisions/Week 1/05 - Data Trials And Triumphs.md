# Data Trials and Triumphs

This read focuses on why accurate interpretation of data is key top data-driven decisions. You have been learning why data is such a powerful business tool and how data analysts help their companies make data-driven decisions for great results. As as quick reminder, the goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data.

> Keep in mind, it is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to the analysts to interpret the data accurately. **When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. Consider the following examples**

## Coke Launch Failure (New Coke)

In 1985, _New Coke_ was launched, replacing the classic coke formula. The company had done taste tests with 200,000 people and found that test subjects preferred the taste of _New Coke_ over _Pepsi_, which had become a tough competitor. Based on this data alone, class Coke was taken off the market and replaced with _New Coke_ this was seen as the solution to take back the market share that had been lost to _Pepsi_.

But as it turns out, _New Coke_ was a massive flop and the company ended up losing tens of millions of dollars. How could this have happened with data that seemed correct? It is because the data wasn't complete, which made it inaccurate. The data didn't consider how customers would feel about _New Coke_ replacing _Classic Coke_. The company's decision to retire _Classic Coke_ was a data driven decision based on incomplete data.

## Mars Orbiter Loss

In 1999, **_NASA_** lost the $125 Million _Mars Climate Orbiter_, even though it had good data. The spacecraft burned to pieces because of poor collaboration and communication. The Orbiter's navigation team was using the _SI or Metric SYstem (Newtons)_ for their calculations,m but the engineers who build the spacecraft used the _ENglish Engineering Units System (Pounds)_ for force calculations.

No one realized a problem existed un,til the Orbiter burst into flays in the Martian atmosphere. Later, a _NASA_ review board investigating the root cause of the problem figured out that the issue was isolated to the software that controlled the thrusters. One problem calculated the thrusters' force in pounds; another program looking at the data assumed it was in newtons,. The software controllers were making data0driven decisions to adjust the thrust bashed on 100% accurate data, but these decisions were wrong because of inaccurate assumptions when interpreting it. A conversion of the data from one system of measurement to the other could have prevented the loss.

**PepsiCo** "hired analytical talent and established cross-functional workflows around an infrastructure designed to put consumers' needs first Then they set up the right processes to make critical decisions based on data and technology use cases. Finally, they invested in the right technology stack and platforms so that data could flow into a central cloud-based hub. This is critical. When data comes together, they develop a holistic understanding of the consumer and their journeys."

## Key skills for Triumphant results

As a data analyst, your own skills and knowledge will be the most important part of any analysis project. It is important for you to keep a data-driven mindset, ask lots of questions, experiment with many different possibilities, and use both logic and creativity along the way, You will then be prepared to interpret your data with the highest levels of care and accuracy. Note that there is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. You learned that making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision, You will learn about how much data to collect later in the program.
