# Design Compelling Dashboards

## Creating a Dashboard

- Here are some process steps you can follow to create a dashboard:

1. **Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it.**

> To get started with this, you will need to ask effective questions. Check out this [Requirements Gathering Worksheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/looker-elearning-resources/Requirements+Gathering+Worksheet.pdf) to explore a wide of good questions you can use to identify relevant stakeholders and their data needs. This is a great resource to help guide you through the=is process again and again.

2. _Design the Dashboard (What should be Displayed)_

User these tips to help make your dashboard design clear, easy to follow, and simple:

- Use a clear header to label the information
- Add short text descriptions to each visualization
- Show the most important information at the top

3. _Create mock-ups if desired_

This is optional, but a lot of data analyst like to sketch out their dashboards before creating them.

4. _Select the visualizations you will use on the dashboard_

> You have a lot of options here and it depends on what data story you are telling. If you need to show a change in values over time, line charts or bar graphs might be the best choice. If your goal is to show how each part contributes to the whole amount being reported, a pie or donut chart is probably a better choice.

You can also visit _Tableau's_ galleries:

- For more samples of area charts, column charts and other visualizations, visit [Tableau's Viz Gallery.](https://www.tableau.com/solutions/gallery) This gallery is full o great examples that were created using real data; explore this resource on your own to get some inspiration.
- Explore [Tableau's Viz of the Day](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) to see visualizations curated by the community. These visualizations created by _Tableau_ users and are a great way to learn more about how other data analysts are using data visualization tools.

5. _Create Filters as Needed_

> Filters show certain data while hiding the rest of the data in the dashboard. This can be a bing help to identify patterns while keep the original data intact. It is common for data analysts to use and share the same dashboard, but manage their part of it with a filter. To dig deeper into filters and find an example of filters in action, you can visit _Tableau's_ page [Filter Actions.](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) This is a useful resource to save and come back to when you start practicing using filters in _Tableau_ on your own.

## Dashboards are Part of a Business Journey

Just like how the dashboard on an airplane shows the pilot their flight path, your dashboard does the same for stakeholders. It helps them navigate the path of the project inside the data. If you add clear markers and highlight important points on your dashboard, users will understand where your data story is headed. Then, you can work together to make sure the business gets were it needs to go.
